# Portofolio Website Using HTML, CSS, javaScript & Sass
You're gonna need to be installing Visual Studio Code for web based projects(though not necessary). It simplifies the workflow

Install it from : `https://code.visualstudio.com/download`

Other dependencies include the Node.js and using Node.js we can install Sass by using the npm Package Manager
```
npm install -g sass
```

The scss script is linked with the HTML using `package.json` 

The sass server can be run from the terminal using the following command in the terminal.
```
npm run sass
```
Preview for the website is available through the `index.html`.
Also if you are using Visual Studio Code Live preview is also available `Alt+L Alt+O`
